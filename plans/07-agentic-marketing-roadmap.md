# 07 - Agentic Marketing Roadmap

## Summary
Build a proof-first marketing system for coding agents based on reproducible commands, machine-readable outputs, and recurring evidence updates.

## Target Audience
- SMB SaaS teams using coding agents.
- Indie builders and OSS maintainers.

## Primary Channel
- GitHub proof content as the main acquisition and trust channel.

## Workstreams

### A. Proof Assets
- `docs/guides/Agents-Quickstart.md`
- `docs/guides/Agent-Use-Cases.md`
- `docs/guides/Why-Core-for-Agents.md`

### B. Comparative Credibility
- Expand `docs/AUDIT.md` with proof table rows linking each claim to command and expected artifact.
- Add reproducibility timestamp fields.

### C. Conversion Surface
- Update `README.md` top section with proof-backed CTA.
- Add docs navigation references for agent-specific guides.

### D. Community Pull Loop
- Add issue templates:
  - `agent-regression-report`
  - `agent-workflow-request`
  - `agent-proof-request`

## Acceptance
- Every top-level claim has a reproducible command.
- Every claim references expected output artifact.
- Verification timestamps are documented.
