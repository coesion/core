# Error (alias)

Overview:
`Error` is a legacy alias for `Errors`. It exists for backward compatibility.

Use this alias only for legacy compatibility; prefer `Errors` in new code so error handling remains aligned with current module naming.

The Error module allow you catch and manage errors.
**DEPRECATED**

The `Error` module is renamed to Errors for incompatibility with PHP7.
