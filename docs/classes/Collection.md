# Collection

Overview:
`Collection` represents a list view for API resources. It handles pagination and list output for exposed resources.

Use `Collection` when exposing list resources through the API module so pagination and list serialization are handled consistently for all consumers.

Usage:
Collection is typically used internally by the API module when a resource is exposed in list mode.
